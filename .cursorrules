# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python3 venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When using Anthropic API tool calling:
  - Tool results should be formatted with `tool_use_id` (not `tool_call_id`) and `content` (not `output`)
  - Tool results should be included as content blocks in a user message, not as a separate `tool_outputs` parameter
  - Assistant messages containing `tool_use` blocks must be followed by user messages with matching `tool_result` blocks
  - Preserve the complete response structure in conversation history, not just the extracted text

# Scratchpad

## Task: Ensure JSON dumps non-ASCII characters properly
The task is to modify app.py to ensure that when JSON is dumped for frontend rendering, `ensure_ascii=False` is set so that non-ASCII characters are displayed properly without Unicode escaping.

Plan:
[X] Find all instances of json.dumps() in app.py
[X] Add ensure_ascii=False parameter to each instance
[X] Test that non-ASCII characters display correctly
[ ] Commit the changes

## Task: Render newlines in tool call results
The task is to properly render newline characters (\n) as actual line breaks in tool call results.

Plan:
[X] Create a new branch
[X] Review the JavaScript code that handles rendering tool call results
[X] Modify index.html to ensure newlines are properly rendered as line breaks
[X] Test the changes
[X] Commit the changes

âœ… Task completed! The changes have been committed to the new branch 'fix/render-newlines-in-tool-results'.
