"""
Tests to ensure that the app functionality works when refactored into separate modules.

These tests verify that the API endpoints and core functionality work correctly
after refactoring the monolithic app.py into separate modules.

The purpose of these tests is to guide the refactoring process and ensure
that functionality is preserved when the code is reorganized.

Usage:
    pytest -v tests/test_app_modularity.py
